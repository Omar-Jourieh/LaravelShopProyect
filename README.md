# LaravelShopProyect

It is a small laravel proyect about a shop where you can add products with a description and a price.
Besides, it doesnt have too much a style, I just did a CRUD to learn about this awesome framework which allows you to build multiple tasks.

However, it is not commented becasuse i thought it was unnecessary due to everything is on the Laravel documentation, it is public so you can use, just let you know it has an auth process so if you download it make sure you have npm package installed in your pc and composer to run it.

Hope you enjoyyy.
